## 📋 Prerequisites

- **SendGrid account** (optional - for email notifications)

## 🛠️ Installation

For complete setup instructions, see **[COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

### Quick Start:

1. **Clone and install**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoadifyMarketLTD/loadifymarket.co.uk.git
cd loadifymarket.co.uk
npm install
```

2. **Set up database**:
   - Create a Supabase project
   - Run `database-complete.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `database-seed-categories.sql` to populate categories
   - Run `database-seed-testdata.sql` for test data (development only)

3. **Configure environment**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
```

4. **Start development**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

**Note:** In **development**, the app falls back to a mock Supabase client when credentials are not configured. In **production**, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are required — the app will throw an error at startup if they are missing (no mock fallback).

## 🏗️ Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is configured for Netlify deployment:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. **IMPORTANT:** Leave the "Build command" field **EMPTY** in Netlify UI (uses netlify.toml)
3. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Deploy!

The `netlify.toml` file is already configured with the correct build command.

**⚠️ Common Issue:** If you see "Prisma schema not found" errors, the Netlify UI has an incorrect build command override. See [NETLIFY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./NETLIFY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the solution.

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
